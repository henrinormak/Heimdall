# Heimdall

In Norse mythology, Heimdall is the gatekeeper of BifrÃ¶st, the rainbow road connecting Midgard, realm of the humans, to Asgard, the realm of gods.

In iOS, Heimdall serves as a gatekeeper between Security framework and the UI, offering a nice wrapper around the C APIs for encrypting, decrypting, signing and verifying messages.

Furthermore, Heimdall also helps maintain the public-private RSA key-pair in Keychain, allowing both creating as well as deleting the key pairs.

## Requirements

Heimdall requires Swift 3 and works with only Xcode 8 and above

## Installation

### CocoaPods

Heimdall is available as a CocoaPod, simply add the following line to your Podfile

```ruby
pod 'Heimdall', '~> 1.0.0'
```

Also, make sure your podfile includes the following line, which is necessary to support Swift frameworks

```ruby
use_frameworks!
```

### Carthage

Simply include the following line in your Cartfile

```
github "henrinormak/Heimdall"
```

Note that Heimdall produces two frameworks in the Carthage build directory - `Heimdall.framework` and `CommonCrypto.framework`, you only need to include/embed `Heimdall.framework` into your project.

### Subproject

As Heimdall makes use of `CommonCrypto` and has it wrapped in a pseudo-module, the easiest way to use Heimdall is to include the entire project as a subproject in your workspace.

To do this, include `Heimdall.xcodeproj` (found in Heimdall folder) into your Xcode workspace. Then specify the `Heimdall` target as a **Target Dependency** for your main application target.

Finally, make sure Heimdall is listed under the **Embedded Binaries** section in Xcode

![Embedded Binaries under application target settings](/Images/embedded_binary.png?raw=true "Embedded Binary")

### Directly

Although not recommended, you can also add Heimdall directly, by including `Heimdall.swift` in your project.

As Heimdall uses `CommonCrypto`, you also need to include a build phase for the following script, which needs to occur before compilation of `Heimdall.swift`

```bash
modulesDirectory=$DERIVED_FILES_DIR/modules
modulesMap=$modulesDirectory/module.modulemap
modulesMapTemp=$modulesDirectory/module.modulemap.tmp

mkdir -p "$modulesDirectory"

cat > "$modulesMapTemp" << MAP
module CommonCrypto [system] {
    header "$SDKROOT/usr/include/CommonCrypto/CommonCrypto.h"
    export *
}
MAP

diff "$modulesMapTemp" "$modulesMap" >/dev/null 2>/dev/null
if [[ $? != 0 ]] ; then
    mv "$modulesMapTemp" "$modulesMap"
else
    rm "$modulesMapTemp"
fi
```

In addition, the add the following path (`$(DERIVED_DATA_DIR)/modules`) to the **Include Paths** (SWIFT_INCLUDE_PATHS) build setting


## Usage

Using Heimdall is simple, for public-private key-pair, you just have to create an instance, which can be used for encryption/decryption, signing/verifying.

With this method you can locally encrypt data to be stored on disk or in a database, without putting everything in the Keychain.

```swift
if let heimdall = Heimdall(tagPrefix: "com.example") {
    let testString = "This is a test string"

    // Encryption/Decryption
    if let encryptedString = heimdall.encrypt(testString) {
        println(encryptedString) // "cQzaQCQLhAWqkDyPoHnPrpsVh..."

        if let decryptedString = heimdall.decrypt(encryptedString) {
            println(decryptedString) // "This is a test string"
        }
    }

    // Signatures/Verification
    if let signature = heimdall.sign(testString) {
        println(signature) // "fMVOFj6SQ7h+cZTEXZxkpgaDsMrki..."
        var verified = heimdall.verify(testString, signatureBase64: signature)
        println(verified) // True

        // If someone meddles with the message and the signature becomes invalid
        verified = heimdall.verify(testString + "injected false message",
                                    signatureBase64: signature)
        println(verified) // False
    }
}
```

### Note on encryption/decryption

As RSA imposes a limit on the length of message that can be enrcypted, Heimdall uses a mix of AES and RSA to encrypt messages of arbitrary length. This is done in the following manner:

1. A random AES key of suitable length is generated, the length is based on the size of the RSA key pair (either 128, 192 or 256 bits) [*](https://github.com/henrinormak/Heimdall/blob/master/Heimdall/Heimdall.swift#L194-L202)
2. The message is encrypted with this AES key
3. The key is encrypted with the public part of the RSA key pair (and padded to the correct block size) [*](https://github.com/henrinormak/Heimdall/blob/master/Heimdall/Heimdall.swift#L213-L218)
4. The payload is built, containing the encrypted key, followed by the encrypted message. During decryption, the first block is always assumed to be the RSA encrypted AES key, this is why Heimdall can only decrypt messages encrypted by other Heimdall instances (or code that is compatible with Heimdall's logic) [*](https://github.com/henrinormak/Heimdall/blob/master/Heimdall/Heimdall.swift#L259-L262)

### Complex use case

A more complex use case involves exchanging encrypted messages between multiple Heimdall instances, which can be situated on multiple different hosts.

First step is to share your public key with another party:

```swift
let localHeimdall = Heimdall(tagPrefix: "com.example")
if let heimdall = localHeimdall, publicKeyData = heimdall.publicKeyDataX509() {

    var publicKeyString = publicKeyData.base64EncodedString()

    // If you want to make this string URL safe,
    // you have to remember to do the reverse on the other side later
    publicKeyString = publicKeyString.replacingOccurrences(of: "/", with: "_")
    publicKeyString = publicKeyString.replacingOccurrences(of: "+", with: "-")

    println(publicKeyString) // Something along the lines of "MIGfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA..."

    // Data transmission of public key to the other party
}
```

Second step, acting as the recipient (the one that wants to send the encrypted message), you receive the public key extracted and create a matching Heimdall instance:

```swift
// On other party, assuming keyData contains the received public key data
if let partnerHeimdall = Heimdall(publicTag: "com.example.partner", publicKeyData: keyData) {
    // Transmit some message to the partner
    let message = "This is a secret message to my partner"
    let encryptedMessage = partnerHeimdall.encrypt(message)

    // Transmit the encryptedMessage back to the origin of the public key
}
```

Finally, having received the encrypted message, the party that sent out the public key can decrypt it using the original Heimdall instance they had:

```swift
// Initial host receives encryptedMessage
if let heimdall = localHeimdall {
    if let decryptedMessage = heimdall.decrypt(encryptedMessage) {
        println(decryptedMessage) // "This is a secret message to my partner"
    }
}
```

The workflow should be mirrored on all hosts, extracting their public keys and sharing those to all other parties. The public keys can be used to construct special Heimdall instances that are only able to encrypt messages and verify signatures.

## Contributing and Current Work

Contributions to the codebase are very welcome, for ideas on what is needed, have a look through the open issues. In addition, any suggestions regarding the following topics are welcome:

* Security, interacting with the Keychain, making sure the results are kept securely etc.
* Tests, adding tests would also likely increase security
* Additional configurability, perhaps allowing non-permanent keys
* Error handling, currently most of the API simply returns `nil`s whenever an error occurs, this should be changed and proper error reporting should be implemented
* Reducing the number of optionals in the public API of the Heimdall instances.
